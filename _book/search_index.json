["setup.html", "Setup", " Setup Here are some notes on running the code in this .Rmd. To run the code, you’ll want to remove eval=FALSE from the code blocks. In what follows we are going to use the mtcars dataset. If you want to run this code in Python, you’ll need access to the dataset. You can get this by doing: pip install ggplot and then in python from ggplot import mtcars Note that in order for the Python code to execute, you need to make sure that Sys.which('python') returns the path for Anaconda rather than Mac OS default python. See here, here and here. The solution I found was cd ~ echo .Renviron &gt;&gt; PATH=/Users/robinlinacre/anaconda/bin "]
